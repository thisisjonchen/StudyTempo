# StudyTempo ✏️

## Description
This was a fun Web App I created to demonstrate skills I learned in JavaScript,
Java Spring, testing API calls, and more! It is a display students can use on a 
second monitor to keep track of time, control music, set timers, and maintain 
their _study tempo_.

**Why did I build this?** I had an extra display and wanted to throw a clock display on it. I didn't like how current iterations on the internet looked and felt, so I made my own:
something simple, minimalistic, yet functional. This was initially supposed to be a tool I would use while working on other projects...until this became my main project :)

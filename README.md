# StudyTempo ✏️

## Description
This was a fun Web App I created to demonstrate skills I learned in JavaScript,
Java Spring, testing API calls, and more! It is a display students can use on a 
second monitor to keep track of time, control music, set timers, and maintain 
their _study tempo_.

## Tech Stack 🥞
Front-End 📲
* JavaScript, ReactJS, HTML, CSS

Back-End ⚙️
* Java, Spring (Web, Data JPA, Security, Test)

Server Deployment ☁️
* AWS S3, EC2, Elastic Beanstalk

Some more things I learned and used ✏️
* ELB, Security Groups, and Ports (AWS, Namecheap)
* API vs. SDK (Spotify)
* Hooks & Props (ReactJS)
* Rate Limiting, CORS 💀, Cookies (Secure, HttpOnly), CSRF, HTTP Request (credentials, body, URL, headers), localStorage

## Third-Party Integrations 📥
So far...
* Spotify (Web API & Playback SDK => react-spotify-web-playback-sdk)
* react-countdown
* react-fullscreen

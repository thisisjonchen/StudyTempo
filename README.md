# StudyTempo ✏️

## Description
This was a fun Web App I created to demonstrate skills I learned in Javascript (+ React),
Java Spring, and testing API calls! It is a display students can use on a second monitor to keep track of time,
control music, set timers, and maintain their _study tempo_.

## Third-Party Integrations
So far...
* Spotify (Web API & Playback SDK
* Google PaLM (Coming Soon)

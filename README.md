# StudyTempo ✏️

## Description
Say hello to StudyTempo: an all-in-one productivity hub built for students to help maintain their _study tempo_.

**Why did I build this?** I had an extra display and wanted to throw a functional "display" on it. I didn't like how current iterations on the internet looked and felt, so I made my own:
something simple, minimalistic, yet functional.

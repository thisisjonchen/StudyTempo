# StudyTempo ✏️

## Description
This was a fun Web App I created to demonstrate skills I learned in Javascript (+ React),
Java Spring, and testing API calls! It is a display students can use on a second monitor to keep track of time,
control music, and maintain their study tempo.

## Third-Party Integrations
So far...
* Spotify
* Google PaLM (Coming Soon)
